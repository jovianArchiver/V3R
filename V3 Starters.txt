Conclussion: While this box doesn't contain a legal list, it's great value for money, and is the pefect expansion for the Hit the Beach Starter. Of note are the Tank Destroyer Platoon and the Armoed Field Artillery Battery, both of which are missing teams. While the former is easy to fix, by buying the Armored Cavalry Recon box, the latter is harder to do so, as the only way to get Staff teams is through the old US Artillery HQ blister, or the 105mm or 155mm Artillery boxes, all of which are OOP.
