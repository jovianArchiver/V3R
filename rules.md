# Playing Flames Of War
## What You Need
## How It Works

# Teams and Units
## Teams
The playing piece is the Team. There are four types: Infantry, Gun, Vehicle and Aircraft teams.

Infantry and Gun teams, and some Vehicles are based in one of three standard base sizes:
· Small: 1"/25mm long by 1¼"/32mm wide
· Medium: 1¼"/32mm long by 2"/50mm wide
· Large: 2½"/ 65mm long by 2"/50mm wide

Teams are listed in the Arsenal. Each team has a variety of Ratings, Weapons and Equipment that affect how they work in the battlefield.
· Name: When a Team is mentioned in an Army List, this is the name that will be used. Some entries include several Teams (eg "M4, M4A1 or M4A4 Sherman"), in cases where several Teams perform identically, but still use different models.
· Mobility: Affects how far a Team can move, and throught what Terrain it is allowed to do so.
· Armor: Represents the thickness and strength of an Armoured Vehicle's armour. It is divided into three areas: Front, Side and Top.
· Weapons: A Team may carry one or more Weapons. These weapons are listed under the name of the have their own ratings.
· Attributes, Equipment and Notes: Attributes and Equipment alter how a vehicle works beyond its most basic functions. These are keywords that reference entries in the Arsenal Keywords and Equipment and National Equipment and Special Rules sections. Most vehicles are equipped with at least one Vehicle MG, and some are given additional equipment, such as Stabilisers in US Tanks.
Notes are not keywords, and instead just state some minor factor of how the Team functions.

Weapons are each defined by these ratings:
· Range: The maximum distance at which a Weapon may fire. In Vehicles, Guns and Aircraft it is measured from the barrel of the gun, and in Infantry it is measured from the center of the base.
· ROF (Rate of Fire) - The number of shots fired by the weapon each turn. It is divided between Stationary and Moving ROF.
· AT (Anti-Tank): The ability of a weapon to penetrate armour. It is used against a Vehicle in an Armor Save.
· FP (Firepower): The effectiveness of a weapon at causing damage to the enemy. In a Firepower Test, a dice is rolled. If the result is equal to or bigger than the Firepower rating, the Test is successful.
· Firing Bombardments: Many weapons have the ability to fire Artillery Bombardments. These weapons have an extra line of ratings, except ROF which will always be listed as -, as artillery bombardments plaster an area with shells rather than firing individual shots at specific targets.

### Infantry Teams
An Infantry Team represents a single fireteam, be it the Command Team of an infantry platoon, a group of riflemen, or a light mortar crew. Cavalry, Motorcycle and Bycicle Teams are also considered Infantry Teams, as they would often dismount and then fight as infantry.

Infantry Teams are mounted on bases. The size of base and number of miniatures on each base depends on the type of Infantry Team.
· Small Infantry Teams: Infantry Teams of one to three miniatures have a small base and face the long edge.
· Large Infantry Teams:  Infantry Teams of four or five miniatures have a medium base and face the long edge.
· Small Cavalry Teams: Cavalry Teams of one or two miniatures have a medium base and face the short edge. These Teams dismount as Small Infantry Teams.
· Large Cavalry Teams:  Cavalry Teams with three or four miniatures have a large base and face the short edge. These Teams dismount as Medium Infantry Teams.
· Motorcycles and Bicycles:  Motorcycle and Bicycle Teams are based and dismount like Cavalry Teams.

### Gun Teams
Gun Teams are weapons intended to fight the enemy at a distance, such as heavy machine-guns, mortars, Anti-Tank guns, Anti-Aircraft guns, rockets, and artillery. Since Gun Teams dont have armour their arsenal entries only have weapons lines with an extra column for their mobility.

Each Gun Team is mounted on a base to keep the gun and crew together. The size of the base depends on the size of the weapon and its crew as shown in the Intelligence Briefing.
· Man-Packed Gun Teams: Man-packed Gun Teams such as HMG and Medium Mortar Teams have a medium base and face the long edge.
· Heavy Mortar Teams: Mortars that are not Man-Packed Guns have a large base and face the short edge.
· Small Gun Teams: Other Gun Teams with four crew have a medium base and face the short edge.
· Large Gun Teams: All Gun Teams with five or more crew have a large base and face the short edge.
· Teams that don't fit: If a Team cannot easily fit on the normal base you might need to rotate the base so they face the short edge or use a larger base. Some Gun Teams have particularly large crews, making it easier to mount some of the crew on an additional medium base. Any extra bases like this are ignored during play.

### Vehicles
Vehicle Teams represent a single vehicle that is usually part of a larger Unit.

· Armoured Vehicles: Armoured Vehicles are any vehicles with armour ratings other than '-'.
· Unarmored Vehicles: Unarmoured vehicles have no armour protection, and are distinguished by having an armour rating of '-' instead of a number.

· Tank Teams: Tank Teams are vehicles whose primary purpose is to shoot the enemy.
· Transport Teams:  Transport Teams are vehicles whose primary purpose is moving other Teams around the battlefield, including armoured half-tracks, trucks and jeeps. Supply, pioneer and demolition carriers, and recovery vehicles are also Transport Teams.

· Vehicle Basing: Vehicles are not normally mounted on bases in Flames Of War, although some vehicles are cast with a base. You can base other vehicles too if you want, but bases on vehicles have no effect on the game. Some self-propelled artillery pieces don't have room on the vehicle for the entire crew. You can either model these on a large base containing both the vehicle and crew, or model the loading crew on a sepparate base.


### Aircraft Teams

### Command and Warrior Teams
· Command Teams: Command Teams are usually either Small Infantry Teams or Vehicle Teams. In order of rank the four types of Command Teams are: Higher Command Teams, Formation Command Teams, 2iC (Second in Command) Teams, and Unit Command Teams.

· Warrior Teams: Warriors are outstanding soldiers who perform amazing feats. Wether their actions are heroic fights against the odds or inspiring leadership in desperate situations these warriors can change the outcome of battles by their strengrh of will and personal courage.
Warriors can be any type of Team. While some are infantrymen, others are tank commanders, and some are even generals travelling in their transport vehicle. Each Warrior Team is unique. There can only be one each particular Warrior in any Force.

· Independent Teams: Senior commanders and artillery observers follow the flow of the battle moving where they are needed. These soldiers are known as Independent Teams and are free to move about the battlefield at will.


## Units
Your Teams are grouped into Units, platoons in most cases, but sometimes companies, typically of three to ten tanks or 30 to 100 infantrymen. In battle a Unit usually operates as one, manoeuvring across the battlefield together and engaging the same foes.

· Unit Command: Each Unit has a Unit Command Team. In the case of Infantry Units, the Command Team is a Small Infantry Team. In Tank, Transport and Gun Units, the Unit Command Team is one of the Vehicle or Gun Teams in the Unit.
· Combat Attachments: At the beginning of the game before Deployment, Units that can make Combat Attachments may permanently Join another unit. If a Unit does so, the Unit's Command Team is removed from the game, and the remainder of the Unit becomes part of the Unit it is making the Command Attachment to.
· Transports: Transport Teams are Vehicle Teams meant specifically to transport other Teams. They are usually unarmed, may be Sent to the Rear and Brought Forward, and do not count towards Unit Morale.
· Loss of Unit Command TeamIf the Unit's Command Team is destroyed, and there it isn't Joined by a Formation Command Team, the Unit immediately becomes Out Of Command.


## Formations
Units are gathered together into Formations, companies in most cases, but sometimes battalions. A Formation contains a number of Combat and Weapons Units, along with Support Units of heavy weapons, scouts, and other troops to back them up.

When you build a Force, you will always have one Primary Formation, and may have one or more Support Formations.

· Formation Command: Each Formation is led by a Company Command (CiC) Team and usually, but not always, a Second in Command (2iC) Team. In addition, the Formation Command may include Support Units. These units may either form the Formation Command Unit with the 2iC leading it, or any or all of the Support Units may make Combat Attachments to any other unit within the Formation.
· Command Leadership: The CiC and 2iC Teams may Join Units during the game. Once per Step, a Formation Command Team may join a Unit if it is within Command Distance of the closest Team.


## Ratings
The three Ratings represent the overall combat capabilities of a Team, Unit or Formation.

When a Unit must perform a task, such as Digging In or fighting in an Assault, the Unit must perform a Test. Additionally, the enemy uses the To Hit Rating of the Unit to determine the dice roll required to hit your Units and Teams.
Sometimes your troops can also be exceptional at one specific task or set of tasks, without increasing the overall rating.

Motivation Rating: Motivation represents the willingness of your troops to keep fighting when the odds are against them. There are four subtypes of Motivation tests: Rally, Remount, Counterattack, and Unit/Formation Morale. The ratings are:
- Fearless 3+
- Confident 4+
- Reluctant 5+

Skill Rating: Skill represents the ability of your troops to complete certain specific tasks. There are two subtypes of Skill tests: Tactics and Assault. The ratings are:
- Veteran 3+
- Trained 4+
- Conscript 5+

To Hit Rating: To Hit represents both the ability of your troops to use concealment, cover and other tools such as smoke, and their willingness to ignore these elements and throw themselves openly at the enemy. The ratings are:
- Careful 4+
- Agressive 3+
- Reckless 2+


## Building a Force
A Force is composed of a Primary Formation, with its Command Unit, Combat Units, Weapons Units, and Formation Support in the form of Support Units and sometimes Support Formations.

When building a Force, choose a Primary Formation. This can be anything from an American Tank Company to a German Panzergrenadierkompanie to a Soviet Strelkovy Batalon. Your Main Formation decides what Force Support is available, both in the form of Support Units and Support Formations.
After you have chosen you Primary Formation, ...

· Limited Support Units: You may take up to as many Support Units as the number of Combat Units in your Main Formation.

### Support Formations
If at least one of the Compulsory Units of a Formation are available to your Force as a Support Unit, instead you may take a Support Formation. This Formation still only counts as one Support Unit towards the number of Maximum Support Units, but behaves as a full Formation, with its own Formation Command Teams and Combat and Weapons Units. Units that can make Combat Attachments may only Join Units from the same Formation. If there are any other Force Support Units that are also Compulsory Units for the Support Formation, the entire box becomes unavailable as if they had already been taken.

# Command
Any Team may be either In Command or Out Of Command. A Team is In Command if it is either:
- within Command Distance of its Unit Command team, or
- within Command Distance of another team from the same Unit that is In Command, thus forming a chain back to the Unit Command Team.

If neither of these applies to a team, it is Out Of Command.

## Command Distance
The Command Distance for Teams within a Unit is based on its rating.

[INSERT COMMAND DISTANCE TABLE HERE]

## Command and Movement
When moving, a Team may either:
- Move so as to be In Command at the end of the Movement Step, or
- Remain in place without moving.

This allows you to leave teams in place to shoot while others move off under their protection. A Unit Command team that moves must end the Movement Step with at least half of the teams in the Unit (not counting Transport Teams) In Command. If this is not possible, the moving Unit Command team must move directly towards teams that are Out Of Command so as to bring at least half of the teams in their Unit (not counting Transport Teams) In Command or as close to In Command as possible.

Teams that start the Movement Step Out Of Command and move in the Movement Step must move to be In Command if possible, or move as close as possible to the Unit Command Team. This does not require the team to Dash.

If the Unit doesn't have a Command Team, its Teams cannot move to be In Command, so cannot move at all.

## Warrior Teams

## Independent Teams
Independent Teams move as if they were their own Unit, and do not need to remain within Command Distance of any other teams.

If an Independent team has a Transport team, the Transport team operates as part of the same Unit as its Independent team. This Transport team does not count towards Morale, Movement Restrictions, and has the same rules as other Transport teams.

## Allied Platoons
An Allied platoon is one of a different nattionality from the Company HQ (or a different branch under the German Reich Divided Special Rule).
Warrior teams and Independent teams may not Join an Allied platoon, and cannot Spot for Allied Artillery Batteries. The exception to this is that US and British teams can Spot for each other's Artillery Bombardments, and German teams can Spot for German Artillery Bombardments, regardless of branch.

# Movement
In the Movement Step you can move any or all of your Units. When a Unit moves, move each of its Teams up to its Movement rating. A Team can Move less than its maximum Movement if you wish, and a Team that does not Move will often be more effective at shooting.

Any team that is not Pinned Down, Bailed Out, Reorganizing or is an Immobile Gun team can move during the Movement Step.

## Mobility
There are two basic types of movement: Tactical and Dash. Tactical movement allows the Team to fire after moving, while Dash allows greater mobility but prevents the team from shooting.

[INSERT MOVEMENT CHART HERE]

### Going To Ground
Teams that do not Move, Shoot, or Assault are Gone to
Ground, making them harder for the enemy to shoot at if
they are also Concealed.

### Moving Through Teams
Tank, Infantry, and Gun Teams cannot Move at Dash speed within 8”/20cm of any enemy Tank, Infantry, or Gun Team. Infantry or Gun Teams cannot move within 2”/5cm of any visible enemy Tank, Infantry, or Gun Team in the Movement Step.

Tank Teams cannot move within 2”/5cm of any visible enemy Infantry or Gun Team in the Movement Step.

Tank and Gun Teams cannot move through other Tank or Gun Teams under any circumstances.

### Moving Through Gaps
A Team can move through any gap it will fit through (ignoring its base if it has one). If the gap is too small to pass through, the Team will have to move through the surrounding terrain.

## Moving Through Terrain
A Team’s Tactical movement speed is not affected by the terrain it is moving over. The Team is focussing on taking cover, so is moving slowly anyway.

A Team’s Dash movement speed depends on the type of terrain it is crossing: Road, Cross-country, or Terrain. If a Team spends its whole Dash move on a Road, it can move rapidly at Road Dash speed. If it spends any of its Dash move in Terrain, it moves at its Terrain Dash speed. Otherwise, it
moves at its Cross-country Dash speed.

### Difficult Terrain
Some terrain is also difficult to cross. Each time a Team attempts to enter or start moving in Difficult Terrain, the player must roll a die. If the result is a 2+, it successfully crosses that piece of terrain. Otherwise, the Team becomes Bogged Down and stops moving immediately. Even if the team is still where it started, it counts as having moved.

### Very Difficult Terrain
When a Team crosses Very Difficult Terrain, instead of crossing on a 2+, it crosses on its cross rating.

If a Tank Unit Leader fails a Cross check, you may nominate another Team from the Unit within 6”/15cm as the new Unit Leader to allow the Unit to continue moving.

Infantry and Man-Packed Gun have a Cross rating of AUTO, meaning that they ignore Difficult Terrain rolls.

### Impassable Terrain
Some terrain is Impassable to some or all Types of Teams. This terrain cannot be entered or crossed by those Teams.

## Movement Orders

## Bogged Down Teams

## Recovery Vehicles

## Transports and Passengers

## Towing Guns and Portees

## Digging In
Instead of Moving in the Movement Step, a Unit may attempt to Dig In foxholes instead of Moving. Roll a Skill check for the Unit. If succesful, mark any or all Infantry and Gun Teams in the Unit as Dug In. Otherwise, the Unit fails to dig in.

Whether or not they succeeded in digging Foxholes, the selected Teams cannot Move, but Shoot with their Moving ROF, and cannot fire an Artillery Bombardment this turn. If they do not Shoot or Assault, they are Gone to Ground as if they hadn't moved.

When Dug In, Infantry and Gun Teams have Bulletproof Cover and are Concealed until they Move.

## Buildings

## Rivers

## Bocage

## Leaving the Battlefield

# Shooting
After completing the Movement Step, your troops open fire on the enemy in the Shooting Step. During the Shooting Step you shoot or fire an artillery bombardment with any or all of your Units, one at a time.

In the Shooting Step, you Shoot with any or all of your Units one by one. When a Unit Shoots, each Team that wants to Shoot in the Unit picks an enemy Team as its target and Shoots its weapons.

Once you’ve finished Shooting with one of your Units, move on to the next until all of the Units that you want to Shoot with have shot.

## Who Can Fire
Any team with at least one weapon listed in their Arsenal is eligible to shoot at the enemy during the Shooting Step. Teams that Dashed this turn may not shoot.

A Tank or Aircraft Team may fire any or all of its weapons. An Infantry or Gun team may only fire one of its weapons.

You can shoot at Tank, Infantry, and Gun Teams with any weapon, but Aircraft can only be shot at by Anti-air weapons.

You shoot at Aircraft in the enemy Shooting Step immediately before the Aircraft Shoots. A team that Shoots at Aircraft cannot:
- Shoot at another Aircraft in this Shooting Step.
- Shoot in Defensive Fire in the Assault Step.
- Shoot in their own Shooting Step next turn.
In addition, the Team may not Assault in their Assault Step next turn and cannot be Gone to Ground until the end of the enemy's next turn.
You may find it useful to mark a Team that Shoots at aircraft.

## Select the Target Units
You must select at least one enemy Unit and/or Independent team to shoot at with the Unit that is shooting. 

## Check Range
## Check Line of Sight
## Check for Concealment
## Declare Targets
## Rotate to Face
## Roll to Hit
## Assign Hits
## Mistaken Target
## Roll Saves
## Destroyed Teams

## Pinned Down Units
Even if you don’t manage to kill the enemy with your Shooting, the weight of fire may pin them down. For soldiers under such intense fire, forward progress is impossible, and even shooting is difficult.
- A Unit becomes Pinned Down if it takes at least five hits in a single Shooting Step. These hits can be from any source or combination of sources, as long as all of the hits were inflicted in the same Shooting Step.
- A Unit also becomes Pinned Down at the end of an Assault in which it took at least one non-Defensive Fire hit.

### Infantry, Gun, And Unarmoured Teams
Infantry, Gun, and Unarmoured Tank Teams in a Pinned Down Unit may not Move closer to any enemy Team in Line of Sight, nor Move into Line of Sight of any other enemy Team. However, they may Dig In or retire away from visible enemy Teams.
A Pinned Down Infantry, Gun, and Unarmoured Tank Team Shoots using its Moving ROF, whether it Moved or not.

### Armoured Tank Teams And Aircraft
Armoured Tank Teams, Passenger Teams mounted in an Armoured Transport, and Aircraft cannot be Pinned Down.

### Rallying From Pinned Down
If your Unit is Pinned Down, you may attempt to Rally it in the Starting Step (page 16) at the start of your turn. Roll a die to do so:
• If the score is greater than or equal to the Unit’s Motivation rating (or Rally rating if different), the Unit recovers fully and is immediately ready to continue the battle.
• Otherwise, the Unit remains Pinned Down.

### Commander’s Leadership
Re-roll all failed attempts to Rally from Pinned Down for Units whose Formation Commander is within 6”/15cm and in Line of Sight of the Unit Leader (including the Commander’s own HQ Unit).

## Bailed Out Tank Teams
Bailed Out Tank Teams may not move (including issuing Blitz Move, Shoot and Scoot, or Follow Me orders) or fight (including Shooting, firing Artillery Bombardments, and fighting in Assaults) until the crew Remount the tank.

### Bailed Out Leaders And Commanders
If a Unit Leader or Formation Commander is Bailed Out
they may, at the start of any Step, swap to another Tank Team
within 6”/15cm that is under their command. Their Bailed
Out tank then replaces their new one in its original Unit.

### Bailed Out Again
Each time a Tank Team that is already Bailed Out would be forced to Bail Out again (whether from Shooting or from Assault or any other reason), roll a Motivation Check. If successful, the shot has no additional effect on the tank. Otherwise, the crew decides that it’s too dangerous to hang around, and the Team is Destroyed.

### Remounting Bailed Out Tank Teams
During the Starting Step at the start of your turn, roll a Motivation Check for each Bailed Out Tank Team. If successful, the crew Remounts their tank and the Team can now act as normal this turn. Otherwise, the Team remains Bailed Out.

### Commander’s Leadership
If the Formation Commander is within 6”/15cm and in Line of Sight, you may Re-roll failed attempts to Remount.

## Gun Team and Vehicle Weapon Attributes
### Weapon Field of Fire
A weapon's Field of Fire is the arc through which it may fire at the enemy. For hits to be allocated to an enemy team, it must be at least partially within the weapon's field of fire. A weapon's Fielf of Fire is based on the team it is Equipped to, and where it is mounted.
· Infantry team:360º Field of Fire.
· Gun team: 180º arc in front of the base.
· Tank Turret: 180º arc to fire without penalty, 360º Field of Fire.
· Hull-mounted: 180º arc in front of the vehicle.
· Turntable: 360º Field of Fire.
· Deck Turret: 360º, except where blocked by the vehicle.
· Side-mounted: 180º arc in front of whichever side the weapon is mounted.
· Hull-rear: 180º arc behind the vehicle.

### Vehicle MGs
Most vehicles are equipped with one or more mounted machine-guns to aid in its defence against infantry and lightly armored enemies. These mounted MGs can be in one or more of the following mounting points, each with its own limitations on its field of fire and usability.
· AA MG: 360º Field of Fire. Fires as a Self-defence Anti-aircraft weapon. Can be fired alongisde other MGs, but not the main gun.
· Co-ax MG: Same field of fire as a Tank Turret gun.
· Cupola MG: 360º Field of Fire. Can be fired alongisde other MGs, but not the main gun.
· Deck Turret MG: Same field of fire as a Deck turret weapon.
· Hull MG: Same field of fire as a Hull-mounted weapon.
· Hull-Rear MG: Same field of fire as a Hull-rear weapon.
· Side-mounted MG: Same field of fire as a Side-mounted weapon.
· Turret-front MG: Same field of fire as a Tank Turret gun. Can be fired alongisde other MGs, but not the main gun.
· Twin MG Turrets: Two Deck Turret MGs. Each may fire at full ROF independently of each other.

There are also additonal attributes that affect a weapon's behaviour.
· Twin MG: This MG fires as if it were two MGs on the same mount.
· Passenger-fired: This weapon may only be fired it the vehicle it's mounted on has at least one *Passenger* during the *Shooting Phase*.
- Portee

### Positive Weapon Attributes
· Smoke: Instead of firing normally, this weapon may fire smoke. If it does so, for each hit against the target, you may place a Smoke Marker in contact with the target enemy Team, and as close to the firing team as possible, or next to any Smoke Markers placed by this team.
· Smoke bombardment:This weapon may fire Smoke bombardments.
- Breakthrough gun
- Bunker buster
- Building destroyer

### Negative Weapon Attributes
· One-man turret: When firing this weapon, if the vehicle it is mounted on moved during the Movement Phase, add a +1 penalty to the To Hit Score.
· Slow traverse: Before rotating the turret to fire at a target, draw an imaginary line aligned with the front of the turret. Any of this vehicle's weapons other than an AA MG that fire at a target in front of this line suffer a +1 To Hit penalty.
· Awkward layout: If the vehicle this weapon is mounted on moved during the previous Movement Phase, it may not shoot its main gun during the Shooting Phase. It may still fire at enemy Aircraft during the enemy Shooting Phase if it is able to do so.
· Limited vision: This vehicle's main gun fires as if it had Slow Traverse. Additionaly, if this vehicle moves, it must rotate its turret to face directly towards the front.
· No HE: Hits from this weapon may not be assigned to enemy Infantry or Gun teams. If the only valid targets are Infantry or Gun teams, all hits from this gun are discarded. This team may still choose to fire as a Rifle.

### Infantry Equipment
· Tank Assault: Any Hit applied by this Team in an Assault against an enemy Vehicle counts as if its AT value were the listed Tank Assault rating.

· Improvised Tank Assault: In addition to the normal Tank Assault rule, this Team is destroyed on any result of 1 when rolling To Hit against an enemy Vehicle.

## Vehicle Attributes and Equipment
### Vehicle Attributes
- Overloaded
- Unreliable

### Vehicle Equipment
- Transport
- Bulldozer
- Mine flail
- Fuel trailer
- DD Tank
- Assault bridge

### Transport Team Attributes
· Pack Mules: Gun teams carried by Pack Mule teams are Mountaineers. Pack Mule teams are Transport teams. Pack Mule teams carry Gun teams as Passengers and the Gun team is removed from the table while it is carried by the Pack Mule team.
· Reinforced truck: If this vehicle is hit, the vehicle does not make a vehicle save. Instead the enemy must roll a Firepower Test. If the enemy passes this test, the vehicle is Destroyed, otherwise ir remains unharmed. To all other effects, this vehicle is an Armoured Transport.
· HMG Carrier: If this vehicle started the turn with an HMG team as a passenger, and until the HMG dismounts, it may fire as if the HMG were a Hull-mounted main gun.

## Specialists
- Flame-thrower
- Rocket launcher
· Mobile rocket launcher: A Mobile rocket launcher Team that fired may roll a Skill check in the Assault Phase instead of attempting a Movement Order or taking part in an Assault. If successful, remove the Smoke Trail markers from all Rocket Launcher teams. Otherwise, nothing happens.
- Recce
- Motorcycle recce
- Recovery vehicle
· Tank Riders: Teams from Tank-rider Units have a 3+ Save while Mounted on a Tank team as Passengers. They do not need to Dismount Under Fire when hit, and may remain Mounted instead. While a Tank has at least one Tank-rider team as a Passenger, it has Tankodesantniki.
· Tank Escorts: Tank Escorts are Tank Riders that are part of a Tank Unit. They do not count towards Unit Morale, and if all Vehicles within the Tank Unit are Bailed Out or Destroyed, they are destroyed as if the Unit fails a Unit Morale test.
- Heavy Anti-aircraft
- Self-defence Anti-aircraft

# National Equipment and Special Rules
## Germany
### Formation and Army Special Rules
· Stormtroopers: Each turn, each German Unit may do one of the following:
  - Reroll a failed Movement Order check.
  - Attempt an additional Movement Order that is not the same as any other Movement Order attempted by this Unit this turn.

  All other Movement Order rules apply as normal.

· Kampfgruppe:
· Mission Tactics: If an Infantry Unit Command team is Destoyed, another team takes over immediately. Remove any other Infantry team in the Unit that is within Command Distance of the Command team and replace it with the original Unit Command team.
