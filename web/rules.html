<h2><a id="playing-definitions" class="anchor" href="#playing-definitions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Basic Definitions</h2>


<h3><a id="definition-team" class="anchor" href="#definition-team" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Teams</h2>
<p>The playing piece is the Team. There are four types: Infantry, Gun, Vehicle and Aircraft teams.</p>
<p>Infantry and Gun teams, and some Vehicles are based in one of three standard base sizes:
	<br><b>· Small:</b> 1"/25mm long by 1¼"/32mm wide.
	<br><b>· Medium:</b> 1¼"/32mm long by 2"/50mm wide.
	<br><b>· Large:</b> 2½"/ 65mm long by 2"/50mm wide.</p>

<h4><a id="turn-sequence-starting" class="anchor" href="#turn-sequence-starting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Infantry Teams</h4>
<p>An Infantry Team represents a single fireteam, be it the Command Team of an infantry platoon, a group of riflemen, or a light mortar crew. Cavalry, Motorcycle and Bycicle Teams are also considered Infantry Teams, as they would often dismount and then fight as infantry.</p>

<p>Infantry Teams are mounted on bases. The size of base and number of miniatures on each base depends on the type of Infantry Team.
<br><b>· Small Infantry Teams:</b> Infantry Teams of one to three miniatures have a small base and face the long edge.
<br><b>· Large Infantry Teams:</b> Infantry Teams of four or five miniatures have a medium base and face the long edge.
<br><b>· Small Cavalry Teams:</b> Cavalry Teams of one or two miniatures have a medium base and face the short edge. These Teams dismount as Small Infantry Teams.
<br><b>· Large Cavalry Teams:</b> Cavalry Teams with three or four miniatures have a large base and face the short edge. These Teams dismount as Medium Infantry Teams.
<br><b>· Motorcycles and Bicycles:</b> Motorcycle and Bicycle Teams are based and dismount like Cavalry Teams.</p>

<h4><a id="turn-sequence-starting" class="anchor" href="#turn-sequence-starting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Gun Teams</h4>
<p>A Gun Team represents a single crew-served weapon, from a light machine-gun or a medium mortar, to a 155mm field howitzer. Since Gun Teams dont have armour their arsenal entries only have weapons lines with an extra column for their mobility.</p>

<p>Each Gun Team is mounted on a base to keep the gun and crew together. The size of the base depends on the size of the weapon and its crew as shown in the Intelligence Briefing.
<br><b>· Man-Packed Gun Teams:</b> Man-packed Gun Teams such as HMG and Medium Mortar Teams have a medium base and face the long edge.
<br><b>· Heavy Mortar Teams:</b> Mortars that are not Man-Packed Guns have a large base and face the short edge.
<br><b>· Small Gun Teams:</b> Other Gun Teams with four crew have a medium base and face the short edge.
<br><b>· Large Gun Teams:</b> All Gun Teams with five or more crew have a large base and face the short edge.
<br><b>· Teams that don't fit:</b> If a Team cannot easily fit on the normal base you might need to rotate the base so they face the short edge or use a larger base. Some Gun Teams have particularly large crews, making it easier to mount some of the crew on an additional medium base. Any extra bases like this are ignored during play.</p>

<h4><a id="turn-sequence-starting" class="anchor" href="#turn-sequence-starting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Vehicle Teams</h4>
<p>Vehicle Teams represent a single vehicle that is usually part of a larger Unit.</p>

<p>Vehicle Teams are either Armoured or Unarmoured. Unarmoured Vehicles have an Armour Rating of '-', which means they have a flat Vehicle Save of 5+, while Armoured Vehicles have Armour Ratings other than '-', instead taking Armour Saves.</p>

<p>Additionally, Vehicle Teams are either Tanks or Transports.
<br>Tanks are Vehicle Teams that have at least one non-MG weapon, except in some cases like the Panzer I being a Tank despite only having MGs, or a Universal Carrier with a PIAT not being a Tank.</p>
<p>Transport Teams are Vehicles with the Transport keyword. Teams with the Rider keyword can still carry Passengers, but are not Transport Teams. Supply, Pioneer and Recovery vehicles and demolition carriers are also Transport Teams, despite being unable to carry .</p>

<p>Vehicles are not normally mounted on bases in Flames Of War, although some vehicles are cast with a base. You can base other vehicles too if you want, but bases on vehicles have no effect on the game. Some self-propelled artillery pieces don't have room on the vehicle for the entire crew. You can either model these on a large base containing both the vehicle and crew, or model the loading crew on a sepparate base.</p>

<p>Command and Warrior Teams</h4></p>
<p><b>· Command Teams:</b> Command Teams are either Small Infantry Teams or Vehicle Teams. In order of rank the four types of Command Teams are: Higher Command Teams, Formation Command Teams, 2iC (Second in Command) Teams, and Unit Command Teams.</p>

<p><b>· Warrior Teams:</b> Warriors are outstanding soldiers who perform amazing feats. Wether their actions are heroic fights against the odds or inspiring leadership in desperate situations these warriors can change the outcome of battles by their strengrh of will and personal courage.
<br>Warriors can be any type of Team. While some are infantrymen, others are tank commanders, and some are even generals travelling in their transport vehicle. Each Warrior Team is unique. There can only be one each particular Warrior in any Force.</p>

<p><b>· Independent Teams:</b> Senior commanders and artillery observers follow the flow of the battle moving where they are needed. These soldiers are known as Independent Teams and are free to move about the battlefield at will.</p>


<h3><a id="definition-unit" class="anchor" href="#definition-unit" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Units</h3>
Teams are grouped into Units, platoons in most cases, but sometimes companies, typically of three to ten tanks or 30 to 100 infantrymen. In battle a Unit usually operates as one, manoeuvring across the battlefield together and engaging the same foes.

· Unit Command: Each Unit has a Unit Command Team. In Infantry or Gun Units, the Command Team is a Small Infantry Team. In Tank and Transport Units, the Unit Command Team is one of the Vehicle or Gun Teams in the Unit.
· Combat Attachments: At the beginning of the game before Deployment, Units that can make Combat Attachments may permanently Join another unit. If a Unit does so, the Unit's Command Team is removed from the game, and the remainder of the Unit becomes part of the Unit it is making the Command Attachment to.
· Transports: Transport Teams are Vehicle Teams meant specifically to transport other Teams. They are usually unarmed, may be Sent to the Rear and Brought Forward, and do not count towards Unit Morale.
· Loss of Unit Command TeamIf the Unit's Command Team is destroyed, and there it isn't Joined by a Formation Command Team, the Unit immediately becomes Out Of Command.

<h3><a id="definition-formation" class="anchor" href="#definition-formation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Formations</h3>
<p>Units are gathered together into Formations, companies in most cases, but sometimes battalions. A Formation contains a number of Combat and Weapons Units, along with Support Units of heavy weapons, scouts, and other troops to back them up.</p>

<p>When you build a Force, you will always have one Primary Formation, and may have one or more Support Formations.</p>

<p>· Formation Command: Each Formation is led by a Company Command (CiC) Team and usually, but not always, a Second in Command (2iC) Team. In addition, the Formation Command may include Support Units. These units may either form the Formation Command Unit with the 2iC leading it, or any or all of the Support Units may make Combat Attachments to any other unit within the Formation.</p>
<p>· Command Leadership: The CiC and 2iC Teams may Join Units during the game. Once per Step, a Formation Command Team may join a Unit if it is within Command Distance of the closest Team.</p>

<h3><a id="turn-sequence-starting" class="anchor" href="#turn-sequence-starting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Ratings</h3>
The three Ratings represent the overall combat capabilities of a Team, Unit or Formation.

When a Unit must perform a task, such as Digging In or fighting in an Assault, the Unit must perform a Test. Additionally, the enemy uses the To Hit Rating of the Unit to determine the dice roll required to hit your Units and Teams.
Sometimes your troops can also be exceptional at one specific task or set of tasks, without increasing the overall rating.

Motivation Rating: Motivation represents the willingness of your troops to keep fighting when the odds are against them. There are four subtypes of Motivation tests: Rally, Remount, Counterattack, and Unit/Formation Morale. The ratings are:
- Fearless 3+
- Confident 4+
- Reluctant 5+

Skill Rating: Skill represents the ability of your troops to complete certain specific tasks. There are two subtypes of Skill tests: Tactics and Assault. The ratings are:
- Veteran 3+
- Trained 4+
- Conscript 5+

To Hit Rating: To Hit represents both the ability of your troops to use concealment, cover and other tools such as smoke, and their willingness to ignore these elements and throw themselves openly at the enemy. The ratings are:
- Careful 4+
- Agressive 3+
- Reckless 2+
